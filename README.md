README File for CS 465 Full Stack Web Application
Overview
This project is a fully functional full stack web application designed to serve both customers and administrators. The application includes a secure login authentication system for administrators and provides CRUD operations for trip data management. The application is built using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack and follows best practices for modular design and security.

Architecture
Frontend Development
The frontend of this application uses a combination of traditional Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) framework with Angular.

Express HTML and JavaScript: These were utilized in the early stages of the project to create static and dynamic web pages. Express provided quick and straightforward methods to deliver content to the browser.
Angular SPA: In later stages, the application transitioned to an Angular SPA framework to deliver a more dynamic and seamless user experience. Angular’s component-based architecture made it easier to modularize the application and enable dynamic updates without reloading the page.
Backend Development
The backend uses Node.js with Express to handle API requests and business logic. A NoSQL MongoDB database was chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of handling JSON-like documents, which aligned well with the application’s needs.

Functionality
JSON and JavaScript
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used to exchange information between the frontend and backend. Unlike JavaScript, which is a scripting language, JSON is a text-based format used for structuring data. JSON bridges the gap between the frontend and backend by providing a common format for data exchange, making the application more cohesive and efficient.

Refactoring and Reusability
Throughout the development process, I refactored code to enhance functionality and improve efficiency. For example:

Refactoring Routes: Consolidated redundant API endpoints into modularized routes, improving maintainability.
Reusable Components: Angular components such as TripCardComponent were created to standardize UI elements across the application, saving development time and ensuring consistency.
Benefits of these practices included reduced development time, easier debugging, and a more polished user experience.

Testing
API Testing
Testing methods involved using tools like Postman to validate API endpoints and ensure they worked as intended. Testing covered:

GET requests: Verifying data retrieval from the database.
POST requests: Ensuring proper data validation and insertion.
PUT requests: Testing data updates with accurate validation.
DELETE requests: Confirming secure and proper data removal.
Security Challenges
Adding admin login authentication introduced complexities in testing due to encrypted passwords and secure session handling. These were addressed by implementing robust error handling and simulating login scenarios to ensure endpoint security and functionality.

Reflection
This course has significantly contributed to my professional growth by equipping me with the skills required to build scalable, secure, and user-friendly full stack applications. Key takeaways include:

Mastery of the MEAN stack: Gaining hands-on experience with MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js.
Enhanced debugging skills: Using tools like Postman and Chrome DevTools to troubleshoot and test applications.
Secure coding practices: Implementing secure login authentication and API endpoint protection.
These skills have made me a more marketable candidate in the tech industry, positioning me for roles in full stack development. This project has solidified my understanding of how to integrate frontend and backend systems while maintaining a focus on user experience and security.
